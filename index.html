    My name is Benny De Bock and I'm a 2nd year student Applied Informatics at HoGent with a focus on Software Development. I'm 23 years old living in Sinaai, Belgium. My interests are Web Development, Design, Application Development, etc... I enjoy learning new things and always try to give it my all for a project. In my free time I also enjoy table tennis at the local club and try to study up on Design a bit.

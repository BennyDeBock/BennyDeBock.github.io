            Welcome to my porfolio! I'm a 2nd year student at HoGent, currently studying to earn a bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics with a concentration in Programming.

            Some of the coding languages I know are Java, C#, .NET, SQL, JS, HTML, CSS, Powershell and Bash. This year, I want to deepen my understanding of Angular for web development and R for data sciences.
        </p>
        <p class="long-copy">
            I want to improve on my coding skills through projects and coding challenges in order to develop applications and websites that creates value for others.
        </p>

            Professionally, my interests are currently focused on web and app development. Outside of that I'm an avid Star Wars fan and I enjoy competitive table tennis, fixing electronic devices, gaming and reading.
